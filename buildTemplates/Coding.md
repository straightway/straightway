# Coding Guideline

## Environment

* Git on github (repositories on https://github.com/straightway)
* Kotlin/JVM

## Development Rules

1. Develop test driven
1. Strive for 100% test coverage
1. Do not suppress warnings and issues without a very good reason.
1. Only push code after
    - all unit tests are green
    - successful "./gradlew check"
