# Straightway

Straightway is a network storage and communication framework. It is planned to have various
applications, ranging from messaging and social media to equal and secret ballot. These
applications shall use the network storage layer
[peerspace]((https://github.com/straightway/peerspace)) as a basis.

Currently, [peerspace]((https://github.com/straightway/peerspace)) is under development, the
applications mentioned above are in a very early conceptual phase.
